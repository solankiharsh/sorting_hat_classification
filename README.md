# sorting_hat_classification
The aim of this project was to build a machine-learning-powered Harry Potter's Sorting Hat that could tell which Hogwarts House you belong to based on given features.  In this notebook I've implemented a simple classification algorithm - Logistic Regression using PyTorch. It performs the function of the Sorting Hat. This investigation has shown that we can train algorithms to sort new data (inputs) into a predefined category/class (outputs).
